## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- Importing `config` no longer creates key files or folders. The keys are created on first use and the reports folder when the app starts. Scripts and tests that only read a setting no longer write into `static_data`
- Sherloc listens on 127.0.0.1 by default. Set `SHERLOC_HOST` and `SHERLOC_ALLOWED_HOSTS` to serve it elsewhere
- `pytest` runs from the repository root
- `config.ADB_PATH` is the plain path of `adb`, not a shell-quoted string
- Scanner tests run against fake `adb`, `pymobiledevice3` and `ideviceinstaller` programs (`tests/fakebin.py`), so they check the exact commands sent and the parsed results without a phone. Coverage of `sherloc/` rose from 41% to 52%, and CI fails below 50%. The canned tool output follows the documented formats; it is not recorded from a real device
- `evidence_collection.py` (1,900 lines) is split into `evidence_choices.py`, `evidence_model.py` and `evidence_forms.py`. It re-exports every name it had, so existing imports work, and `tests/test_evidence_collection_api.py` fails if one goes missing
- CI runs the test suite on pushes and pull requests. A lint ratchet (`tests/test_lint_ratchet.py`) fails on any new undefined name, invalid escape, mutable default argument, bare `except`, `shell=True` or `eval`; existing findings are recorded in `tests/lint_baseline.json`
- The stalkerware-indicators workflow uses the `sherloc/` paths and a single `token:` key (the duplicate key meant `IOC_UPDATE_KEY` was ignored), and its script exits non-zero when its requirements are missing. It no longer tries to open a PR on pull request runs
- super-linter checks changed files for serious Python problems and executable bits only; style linters were failing on the existing code
### Added
- A notice at the top of every page shows when client data is stored on the computer, with a count for each kind
- `tests/test_client_data_leak.py` fills every place the app writes client data, deletes, and searches the whole tree for the text. `tests/test_data_write_sites.py` fails when code adds a new place that writes files or opens a database without it being listed and classified in `tests/data_write_sites.json`
### Fixed
- A failed uninstall was reported as a success, and the app was recorded as deleted in the database even though it was still on the phone. `uninstall` now returns False when the tool exits non-zero, prints `Failure`/`ERROR`, is missing or times out
- A failed `adb` app listing was read as a list of apps (the error text). It now restarts the adb server and returns no apps
- Android device descriptions no longer keep the newline that `getprop` prints
- "Delete client data" stopped at the first missing folder (for example before any scan) and never reached the database. Each folder is now handled independently
- `python main.py test` did nothing: the call to `set_test_mode` discarded its result, and by then the paths had already been read. The `test` argument is now applied before `config` is imported
- A missing blocklist file made the app exit with status 0 and a one-line message. It now exits with an error
- 30 function arguments defaulted to a shared `list()`/`dict()`; each call now gets its own. Invalid escape sequences in 15 string literals are now raw strings (same values). A bare `except` in `/scan` is now `except ValueError`
- Android and iOS uninstall now target the scanned device (`adb -s`, `ideviceinstaller --udid`). Before, adb refused to run with more than one device attached. `delete_app` only accepts a serial that matches the scan
- iOS screenshots no longer break when the install path contains a space, and the `pymobiledevice3` tunnel process is stopped after each screenshot instead of being left running
- "Close App and End Session" never worked: it relied on `werkzeug.server.shutdown`, which Werkzeug 2.1+ removed. It now stops the app after sending its response
- `/view_results` raised a `NameError` for any existing scan. Removed unreachable or uncalled code that used undefined names (`index.py`, `android_permissions.py`, and `update_app_deleteinfo` in `db.py`, which also had an SQL typo). The lint check now fails on undefined names
### Security
- Client notes, client names, device serials and app lists are no longer printed to the terminal. Terminal output outlives "Delete client data". Run with `DEBUG=1` to see it. Fixed messages such as "Uninstall failed" still print
- Folders that hold client data are created owner-only (`0700`), existing ones are tightened, and the app sets `umask 077`, so files made by the app or by the programs it starts are `0600`. An older database file is tightened at start. When Sherloc runs under `sudo`, those files belong to root
- Screenshots are saved in the folder that "Delete client data" empties (`config.SCREENSHOT_DIR`), not in a second hard-coded path
- No command runs through a shell any more. Every `adb`, `ideviceinstaller`, `pymobiledevice3` and script call is an argument list, so no value can be read as a command. `run_command` rejects a string. The package lookup (`sed` on the dump) and the pipes (`grep`, `sort`, `awk`, `tail`) are done in Python. The lint baseline is now empty
- App ids are validated before the package lookup and the recent-permissions lookup
- Request log lines show the route pattern instead of the URL, so device serials and app ids no longer appear in the terminal output
- Deleting client data, deleting a scan or account, and closing the app now require POST. A GET (an image tag, a link prefetch) could trigger them. The buttons are now forms
- App descriptions from the app-store crawls are reduced to a few formatting tags before rendering. They were inserted unescaped, so a published app could run script in the consultant's browser
- `/details/app` validates the app id and serial, and returns 404 for an unknown device
- App ids are passed to the delete-app handler as JSON, not pasted into a JavaScript string
- Deleting client data now also empties the database (client notes, scans and app remarks). Before, only files were deleted and the notes stayed in `fieldstudy.db`. Deleted content is overwritten and the file is compacted
- SQL statements are no longer echoed to the log (they included client notes and serials). Set `SHERLOC_SQL_ECHO=1` to turn echo back on for debugging
- Device serials and app ids are validated before they reach a shell command. Previously a crafted serial or app id, or a serial reported by a device, could run commands
- Fixed quoting in the Android and iOS uninstall commands that made `shlex.quote` ineffective
- Screenshot paths are limited to the screenshots directory
- Requests with a foreign `Host` header, a cross-origin `Origin` on state-changing methods, or a non-same-origin `Sec-Fetch-Site` are rejected, so another website cannot trigger scans, uninstalls, or data deletion
- `sherloc/static_data/pii.key` and `flask.secret` are no longer tracked by git and are ignored. Both files were public, so anyone could compute the `HSN_` device identifiers and forge session cookies. Keys are generated on first run with owner-only (0600) permissions, and a key file that still holds one of the previously published values is replaced. Existing installs get new keys after pulling, so stored `HSN_` identifiers will change. The old values remain in git history
- The PDF printout escapes notes, names and app text, and wkhtmltopdf no longer has local file access. Previously a note containing an `<iframe src="file://...">` tag put the contents of a local file into the report
